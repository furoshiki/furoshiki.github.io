            <p class='catch'>I've been connecting the world and Japanese subculture ecosystem with internet technology.</p>
            <p>There are various creative activities, such as Disney and Hollywood, that connect the world with inspiration.
              However subcultures, such as manga and anime, also connect that people each other.
              The Japanese traditional expression is unique, and yet it already attracts many people around the world.
              I bring that Japanese-styled entertainment to such people and more, and contribute to making a place where creative people involved in subcultures are able to succeed beyond its borders.</p>
            <p>Summary of my skills:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Developing new businesses in the Japanese entertainment industry and other global markets such as Asia Pacific regions and the United States</li>
              <li>Building new teams which are focusing on using advanced internet technology and branding for tech community</li>

                  <p>
                    I joined pixiv Inc. in 2015 as a web developer and was assigned to the development team for <a href='https://booth.pm/en'>BOOTH</a>, an e-commerce platform for artists.
                    I formed a team with a few engineers and we began to relaunch the new user experience and to build community management works of that product.
                    After these activities, I could quantify and explain the difference in user experience between a typical platform and an artist platform.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And from 2016, I have been involved in the other teams developing creation tools and artist social media in the capacity of a manager.
                    Since 2019, I've been in a position to support the company's overall international expansion, setting up a marketing team, a product internationalization team, and a legal team.

                  <img src='img/pixiv_tech_salon.jpg' alt="pixiv Tech Salon" class='right'>
                  <p>
                    pixiv Inc. was in its early phases and it was common to have multiple roles. When I first joined the company, I had a problem with technical public relations. Firstly I started to build a relationship between tech communities and my company to activate the corporate brand at pixiv Inc.
                    After reviewing these accomplishments, I joined the management team to develop a yearly budget and rules for technical publicity and launched the on-demand media.
                    At the same time, I evaluated the technical skills of all 60+ engineers for every quarters and also overseen the design of the organization rule.
                    What I am now required by the company to do is to build a team that requires a high degree of technological novelty and that branding.
